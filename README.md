# Combining pre-trained models:
  - why: <br>
      - Because it is the ability of learning from others experience ([Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.07873))
      - and others experience are pre-trained models
      - 


# The Plan
- [ ] Understand how to make sense of simple pre-trained models
- [ ] Create an agent capable of learning from pre-trained models
- [ ] Maybe re-design format of current trained models to make them better suited for sharing information
