# An Approach to Artificial General Intelligence
 -Overview:
Welcome to the research project on "An Approach to Artificial General Intelligence"! This project aims to explore various aspects of achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) by leveraging large language models (LLMs), combining pre-trained models, studying cognitive architecture, neurosymbolic approaches, and investigating consciousness. This project is open source, and we encourage contributions from the AI community to further advance our understanding of AGI.

Project Goals
The primary goals of this research project are as follows:

Combining Pre-Trained Models for Experimentation:
The ability to learn from others' experiences, known as federated learning, plays a crucial role in advancing the field of Artificial General Intelligence.
In this research project, our aim is to explore the potential of combining pre-trained models for experimentation on LLMs. We will focus on the following steps:

-Training Our Own LLMs on top of pre-trained models
-Understanding the Capabilities of Simple Pre-Trained Models
-Creating an Agent Capable of Learning from Pre-Trained Models
-Redesigning Trained Models for Improved Information Sharing

Studying Cognitive Architecture and Neurosymbolic Approaches:
To achieve Artificial General Intelligence, we recognize the importance of studying the human brain and its cognitive processes. 

-Investigate the brain's architecture and cognitive mechanisms, aiming to build a cognitive architecture that can mimic key aspects of human intelligence. 
-Researching neural network architectures, memory systems, attention mechanisms, and learning algorithms.
-Explore neurosymbolic approaches, integrating symbolic reasoning with neural networks to enable more interpretable and explainable AI systems. 

Investigating Consciousness and its Relationship to Intelligence:
One of the fundamental inquiries in this research project is to explore the intricate relationship between intelligence and consciousness. Our aim is to delve into whether these two aspects are intrinsically interconnected or exist as separate entities. Are intelligence and consciousness a two-side of the same coin?

-By analyzing the neural correlates of consciousness and investigating the role of embodiment and sensorimotor interaction, we hope to shed light on the intricate dynamics between these cognitive phenomena.


Ultimately, our research endeavors to deepen our understanding of intelligence and consciousness, their potential interconnectedness, and the boundaries they may share.

By combining these research areas, we seek to bridge the gap between neuroscience and AI and the ultimate quest of understanding of Consciousness.
